# Welcome to the SalesTim URL Shortener repo

## ABSTRACT

This repository contains assets for making an URL Shortener with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

View the URL Shortener in action: https://fa-st.co

> [URL shortening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening) is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page.

## A. CONFIGURATION

Edit the `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
title: SalesTim URL Shortener
description: ‚úÇÔ∏èüîó This repo hosts SalesTim URL Shortener (built with with Jekyll and GitHub Pages).
logo: /assets/img/color.png
show_downloads: false
google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXX-YY
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
permalink: /:slug/
plugins:
  - jekyll-redirect-from
```

Usage:
- Change the `title` and `description` to something you like. Consider to make your own `logo` by replacing the `/assets/img/logo.png` image.
- The `show_downloads` flag indicates whether to provide downloads links for the code in the repository on the site.
- Set the `google_analytics` tracking code if you are interested in the website traffic.
- Read more about the `theme` at https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal
- The global `permalink` for pages is set to `/:slug/`.
  - Permalinks are the output path for your pages, posts, or collections. They allow you to structure the directories of your source code different from the directories in your output.
  - Slugified title from the document‚Äôs filename (any character except numbers and letters is replaced as hyphen). May be overridden via the document‚Äôs `slug` front matter.

Read more about permalinks at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/

It is the `jekyll-redirect-from` plugin that does the redirecting from the *short link* to the *target page*.
Read more about the plugin at https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from

## B. USAGE

***How to create a new link?***

Create a new file in the root, such as `<your-keyword>.md`.  
Include this content in the file:

```markdown
---
title: <title>
redirect_to: <redirect-to>
redirect_from:
  - <alias>
---
```

- The `<title>` could be used to describe the target page. Consider to take the *exact* title of the target page.
- The `<redirect_to>` is the URL to the target page. This is the only [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) that is mandatory to make the short link work.
- The `<redirect_from>` is a list of aliases to the keyword, preceded by a "`/`" character, for instance `/TechHub`. This [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is optional but recommended.

Best Practices:
- Keywords by default are **case-sensitives**, but you can include aliases to accept multiple variations for the same keyword, such as `/TechHub`, `/tech-hub`, `/Tech-Hub`...
- Don't forget, your file MUST start AND end with the `"---"` lines.
- Use only alphanumeric and lower-case characters for keywords.
- Separate keywords by using the `"-"` character.
- The file can have a `.md` (Markdown) or `.html` extension, but please use `.md` for consistency.
